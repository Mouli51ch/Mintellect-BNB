## üßë‚Äçüíª Main App Workflow

1. **Upload Document:** Users upload their research paper (PDF, DOCX, TXT, LaTeX).
2. **Eligibility & AI Analysis:** The backend checks eligibility, runs plagiarism detection, and generates a trust score using Gemini 2.5 Flash.
3. **Human Review (Optional):** Community reviewers can provide additional credibility.
4. **NFT Minting:** Eligible papers can be minted as NFTs on the BNB Testnet.
5. **Gallery & Analytics:** Users can view, analyze, and share their NFT certificates. Analytics dashboard visualizes research activity.

## ü§ù Peer Review Consensus Protocol

Mintellect uses a decentralized, consensus-driven peer review protocol to ensure fairness, transparency, and credibility in research validation. The process is as follows:

1. **Research Paper Submitted:** The author submits a research paper to the platform.
2. **Assigned to Reviewer Pool:** The paper is assigned to a pool of eligible reviewers.
3. **Reviewer Selection:** Reviewers are selected through a randomized process to avoid bias.
4. **Selected Reviewers:** The chosen reviewers are notified and assigned the paper.
5. **Review Submitted Individually:** Each reviewer evaluates the paper independently and submits their review.
6. **Consensus Evaluation:** The system evaluates the reviews for consensus.
    - If the majority of reviewers agree, the review is accepted.
    - If there is disagreement, a re-evaluation round is triggered.
7. **Re-evaluation Round:** Additional reviewers are assigned to the paper for further assessment.
8. **Consensus Recalculated:** The consensus is recalculated with the new reviews.
9. **Finalization:**
    - If consensus is reached, the paper is minted as a verified NFT and the reputation scores of reviewers are updated.
    - If disagreement persists, the process may repeat until consensus is achieved.

This protocol ensures that only high-quality, community-validated research is minted as a verified NFT, and that reviewer reputation is transparently managed.
